			A new <strong><i>development<br></i></strong> in my life</div>

					<p><br>I’ve got a degree! Yes, the big bold words under my full name (Hannabeth -no space, if you’re wondering) and all the Latin say Mechanical Engineering, and yes I’m pursuing a role in Computer Science. Let’s rewind.
						<br><br>
					I started my college career pursuing an engineering degree as a young student drawn to the potential that an engineering discipline presented in solving real-world problems. But I was Luke Skywalker and engineering was my uncle’s farm on Tatooine. When I first started, I thought my life was going to go one way and one way only. It wasn’t until I took a computer science course on a whim midway through my coursework, that my journey with the Force (capital F) began. 
					<br><br>
					I marveled at the way complex issues crumbled under the application of smart-thinking and logic. If the future is digital, I wanted to meet it head-on and with a skillset that would allow me to not only understand the new set of problems that would exist, but how to solve them.
					Due to the rigor of the engineering program, I was told that taking any additional courses would make it nearly impossible to graduate on schedule, but the Force was strong with this one. I was able to get a Certificate in Computer Science under my belt in addition to my engineering degree. 

					<br><br>
					I’m proficient in some of the big languages (Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript) and have worked with them on several projects in the past (see projects page). I also love teaching myself new languages and understanding the nuances of working with each one. I’m in the process of developing my HTML and CSS skills (check out this website!) and dabbling a bit a in Swift. :)
